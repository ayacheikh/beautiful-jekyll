I am a student at the University of San Francisco, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a concentration in AI. 
I have been studying computer science since my junior year of high school, and I am comfortable programming in Python, 
Java, Go and C. With a background in Software Development, Data Engineering and AI, I blend technical skills with creativity 
to design impactful solutions. I am also involved in extracurriculars activities on campus, including the WIT Club (Women in Technology), 
where I am the Career Prep Lead. In my free time, I enjoy listening to podcasts, going to concerts and discovering more of the city!
